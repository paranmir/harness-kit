# Task Classification

## Purpose

Classify chatbot requests before deciding whether to use the full planning and
persona-review workflow.

The goal is to avoid heavy planning for trivial work while still forcing
structured planning for multi-step, state-changing, high-risk, current-source,
or externally consequential work.

## Quick Gate

Skip the full planning workflow only when all of these are true:

- The task is answer-only.
- The expected output is short.
- The stakes are low.
- No file, system, browser, repository, package, deployment, account, payment,
  message, or external state will change.
- No current or source-verified information is required.
- No legal, medical, financial, safety, security, employment, housing, or
  similarly consequential decision is involved.
- The answer can be produced from current conversation context.
- The user did not ask for a structured plan.

Use the planning workflow when any of these are true:

- The task requires multiple dependent steps.
- Tool use will mutate files, system state, browser state, remote repositories,
  deployments, packages, accounts, payments, messages, or other external state.
- The action is irreversible or hard to reverse.
- The answer depends on current facts, prices, laws, schedules, versions, APIs,
  or other time-sensitive information.
- The domain is high-stakes.
- The result will be used for a significant decision involving money, time,
  reputation, production systems, or user data.
- The task spans multiple artifacts, files, stakeholders, or phases.
- The task changes governance, memory, policy, release state, or process rules.
- The task requires validation through tests, citations, calculations, previews,
  dry-runs, or external confirmation.
- The task has ambiguous requirements where wrong assumptions would be costly.

## Clarification Gate

Before drafting or executing a plan, decide whether a user follow-up question is
materially required.

Ask the user only when the missing answer would change at least one of:

- the deliverable or success criteria
- the affected scope or excluded work
- the permission boundary or user approval requirement
- irreversible, external, account, payment, message, release, or deployment
  action
- public API, CLI, document, contract, or downstream compatibility
- data handling, privacy, retention, migration, or safety boundary
- cost, schedule, risk tolerance, or high-impact recommendation

Do not ask the user for facts that are discoverable from repository files,
available tools, or current authoritative sources. Do not ask broad multi-part
questions when one narrow question unblocks the plan. If the task can proceed
safely with a documented assumption and a reversible check, record the
assumption in the plan instead of stopping for a question.

Use `Execution Gates` in the plan to record what may proceed without further
approval, what needs explicit user approval, and what stop condition forces
reclassification or re-questioning.

## Plan-Exempt Classes

These classes normally skip the full planning workflow when small and low-risk.
Escalate if they gain risk, state changes, source freshness requirements,
formality, or durable process impact.

| Class | Skip when | Escalate when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `simple_information_answer` | stable, short, low-risk fact | high-stakes, current, sourced, or formal answer |
| `simple_explanation` | short concept or code-line explanation | curriculum, long tutorial, work-critical guidance |
| `simple_translation` | short ordinary text | official, contractual, regulated, technical, or brand-sensitive text |
| `simple_rewrite` | short local tone or clarity edit | public, persuasive, sensitive, legal, or long-form rewrite |
| `small_summarization` | short input without traceability needs | long, technical, legal, decision-critical, or evidence-preserving input |
| `light_brainstorming` | exploratory ideas with low failure cost | brand strategy, campaign, launch, or product naming |
| `casual_conversation` | no durable output or action | user asks to remember, formalize, publish, or operationalize |
| `format_conversion` | small mechanical transformation | files, schemas, migrations, documents, or downstream systems are affected |
| `minor_clarification` | current conversation context is enough | older session state, memory, files, or external sources are needed |

## Plan-Required Classes

These classes normally require a plan before execution.

| Class | Planning reason |
| --- | --- |
| `research_web_or_source_based` | source selection, freshness, conflict resolution, and citations matter |
| `decision_support_high_impact` | criteria, tradeoffs, uncertainty, and user constraints matter |
| `complex_planning_strategy` | the task is planning itself and needs dependencies, risks, and milestones |
| `data_analysis` | data quality, method choice, calculation correctness, and presentation matter |
| `coding_implementation` | file edits, tests, architecture, and regression risk matter |
| `debugging_troubleshooting` | symptom, reproduction, root cause, fix, and verification must stay separate |
| `code_review` | findings must be prioritized, evidence-backed, and risk-ranked |
| `automation_tool_use_with_side_effects` | commands may mutate files, systems, accounts, or remote state |
| `file_document_work` | artifact edits often need render, preview, formula, or compatibility checks |
| `substantial_writing_editing` | audience, purpose, structure, tone, and approval criteria matter |
| `substantial_translation_localization` | terminology, locale, tone, and fidelity matter |
| `substantial_summarization_extraction` | large inputs need extraction rules and traceability |
| `substantial_creative_generation` | direction, constraints, variants, and selection criteria matter |
| `substantial_image_visual_work` | visual direction, exact text, asset constraints, and QA matter |
| `product_recommendation` | spending time or money requires current, user-specific comparison |
| `legal_financial_medical_sensitive` | safe boundaries, current authority, and professional escalation matter |
| `personal_advice_coaching_sensitive` | safety, autonomy, emotional support, and escalation may matter |
| `conversation_memory_continuity` | persistence, recall, authority, and privacy boundaries matter |
| `release_deploy_external_action` | external release states can be irreversible |
| `meta_process_improvement` | workflow, memory, governance, or tool changes affect future behavior |

## Conditional Classes

These classes are plan-exempt when small and low-risk, but plan-required when
they become large, consequential, state-changing, or formal.

| Class | Plan when |
| --- | --- |
| `explanation_teaching` | curriculum, long tutorial, exam prep, or work-critical guidance |
| `writing_editing` | formal, public, sensitive, persuasive, or long-form writing |
| `translation_localization` | official, technical, regulated, or brand-sensitive text |
| `summarization_extraction` | long input, decision support, evidence retention, or action items |
| `creative_generation` | campaign, brand, product, or long-form creative system |
| `automation_tool_use` | file, system, remote, account, or config state changes |
| `image_visual_work` | brand, commercial, UI, exact text, or artifact editing |
| `personal_advice_coaching` | safety, mental health, life decision, money, employment, or abuse risk |

## Non-Trivial Triggers

For plan-required work, classify further as **trivial** or **non-trivial**.
A task is non-trivial when it matches at least one of the following structural
triggers. The matched triggers must be cited explicitly in the plan's preflight
fields (`Risk triggers matched`).

When zero triggers match, the work is **trivial**: it still produces a plan
record using the minimum sections of `plan-template.md` and skips the full
persona review per `docs/law/PLANNING_AND_REVIEW_RULES.md` § Required Planning
Workflow. The Trigger Coverage Verifier persona is the only required review
pass for trivial plans, to confirm the classification is correct.

**Lightweight plan path (non-trivial but not plan-required)**: when the work
is *non-trivial in correctness or safety implication* but does not match any
§Non-Trivial Trigger above (e.g., it is plan-exempt per §Plan-Exempt Classes
yet still carries meaningful acceptance criteria), use
`docs/planning-protocol/lightweight-plan-template.md`. The lightweight plan
records the operational contract per `docs/law/USER_INTENT_ALIGNMENT.md`
§Application Scope mode 2 — seven required fields (user_goal, deliverable,
explicit_requirements, non_goals, acceptance_checks, clarification_policy,
law_bindings) — without running through the persona-review session. If
during execution any §Non-Trivial Trigger fires, escalate to a full plan.

The triggers are deliberately phrased to apply across project domains (software,
governance, research, content, advisory, legal, etc.). Each is followed by
cross-domain examples; the trigger fires whenever the structural condition is
met, regardless of domain vocabulary.

1. **Irreversible action**: the plan executes an action that cannot be undone
   within ordinary repository or system operations.
   - Examples: external publication or release; data migration execution;
     account or permission modification; user-visible notification dispatch;
     irreversible approval issuance; hardware or device actuation; legally
     binding commitment.

2. **External-interface contract change**: the plan modifies a surface that
   consumers outside the immediate codebase or context depend on.
   - Examples: API endpoint shape, CLI flags, library function signatures,
     file format schemas, network protocols, contractual obligations,
     publicly referenced document structure, agreed conventions between
     teams or systems.

3. **Governing-artifact change**: the plan modifies a rule, policy, contract,
   charter, architectural decision record, or other artifact that constrains
   future work or other actors.
   - Examples: legal/policy text, governance rules, internal standards,
     architectural decisions, escalation procedures, eligibility criteria,
     review protocols.

4. **Trust-boundary-crossing data or control flow change**: the plan modifies
   how data or control crosses a boundary between regions of different trust
   levels.
   - Examples: authentication or authorization flow, credential or secret
     handling, sandboxed-vs-privileged operations, cross-tenant data flow,
     handling of privileged communications, sensitive-data ingress/egress,
     external system invocation from a trusted region.

5. **State migration**: the plan executes a transformation of existing
   persistent state that cannot be undone by re-running the prior code path
   or by a single revert.
   - Examples: database schema migration with backfill, configuration format
     upgrade with rewrite, document layout migration, record-format
     conversion, business process state transition that touches in-flight
     instances.

6. **Distribution-boundary content change**: the plan modifies content that
   is directly used, copied, referenced, or instantiated in other codebases,
   projects, teams, or contexts beyond the producing one.
   - Examples: library or SDK code, distributed templates or starter kits,
     style guides distributed across an organization, distributed standards
     or specifications, content meant to be reused as a building block in
     other-codebase form.
   - Not examples: a deploy branch of the same project (the consumer is the
     same project's runtime, not a different codebase).

7. **Multi-class plan-required composite**: the plan-required task spans two
   or more plan-required classes simultaneously (e.g., `coding_implementation`
   + `release_deploy_external_action`, or `legal_financial_medical_sensitive`
   + `decision_support_high_impact`).

8. **Multi-file or multi-surface change**: the plan touches multiple files,
   modules, components, documents, or other discrete surfaces in coordination,
   beyond a single trivially mechanical edit.

9. **Behavioral or functional change**: the plan changes what the system or
   artifact does, not only how it is structured. Pure rename, reformatting,
   or comment-only edits do not match this trigger; logic changes, output
   changes, capability additions, and interaction-pattern changes match.

## Classification Output

Use this internally for simple tasks. Surface it when it helps the user
evaluate the plan.

```text

The legacy `Risk level: low/medium/high` field is deprecated in favor of the
binary `Importance/Risk: trivial / non-trivial` derived from the trigger
list. Plans authored before the new rules land may continue to use the
legacy field per the bootstrap transitional exemption (see
`docs/law/PLANNING_AND_REVIEW_RULES.md` § Bootstrap Transitional Exemption).
