# Review Method

## Purpose

Turn a draft plan into a safer revised plan by reviewing it from targeted expert
perspectives.

Personas improve the plan. They do not execute the task, replace tests, or
create an endless review loop.

## Workflow

Use this sequence when `task-classification.md` says planning is required:

1. Classify the request and identify task class(es).
2. Run the Clarification Gate from `task-classification.md`. Ask the user only
   for missing answers that materially change scope, safety, permission,
   irreversible action, public contract, cost, or the intended outcome. Record
   the result in the plan's `Execution Gates`.
3. Determine importance/risk by checking against
   `task-classification.md` § Non-Trivial Triggers. Cite each matched
   trigger.
4. Draft the plan using `plan-template.md`. For non-trivial work, self-mark
   the applicable conditional domains in the Domain Coverage section.
5. Run plan-lint checks. Until a standalone `plan-lint` command exists, the
   active-plan checks in `agentlaw verify` are the repository's mechanical
   enforcement surface.
6. Run the **Trigger Coverage Verifier** first in an isolated review pass. It
   validates the trigger marking and the Domain Coverage self-mark against the
   plan content.
7. For non-trivial work, run the **Deep Review Selector** and then run selected
   deep-review personas one at a time, sequentially. Each selected persona is
   invoked in its own turn so lens injection from one persona does not
   cross-contaminate the next persona's review.
8. Run review-lint checks over review outputs.
9. Consolidate findings.
10. Revise the plan. **Section-based re-review**: when revisions affect a
   specific subset of plan sections, re-invoke only the personas whose
   primary or optional sections (per `persona-section-map.md`) include the
   revised sections. Personas whose sections were not revised do not need
   re-invocation.
11. Execute the revised plan or ask for user approval when required by
    `Execution Gates`.

For trivial plan-required work, only step 5's Trigger Coverage Verifier
runs. If it confirms the trivial classification, no further personas
execute. If it finds a missed trigger, the plan is reclassified as
non-trivial and the workflow restarts from step 4.

Do not store long duplicate draft and revised plan bodies unless the task
is so high-risk that preserving both bodies is itself useful evidence. The
default plan artifact should keep the final executable plan plus compact
review evidence fields and short notes.

Required review evidence fields for review-required plans:

```text
Risk triggers matched: <list of cited triggers from § Non-Trivial Triggers>
Importance/Risk: trivial / non-trivial
Domain self-mark: <conditional domain checklist; non-trivial only>
Deep Review Selection: <selected/skipped review summary; non-trivial only>
Review required: yes
Plan reviewed: yes
Personas applied: <non-empty persona list>
Revised after review: yes
Execution Gates: <approval and stop-condition summary>
```

Review-required plans must also include a short section:

```text
## Separate Persona Review Passes

### <Persona name>

- Status: PASS / FAIL / N/A
- Severity: must-change / should-change / note
- Inspected sections: <plan sections read>
- Evidence: <specific plan text or absence that supports the finding>
- Plan risk found: <concrete risk>
- Required plan change: <specific plan edit>
- Verification or gate to add: <test, check, approval, or explicit none>
- Residual risk if accepted: <remaining risk>
```

When a legacy plan's persona pass predates the strict review-lint fields, a
compact PASS shape remains accepted for compatibility:

```text
### <Persona name>

- PASS: no concrete plan change.
```

Compact PASS is valid only for no-finding persona passes. New plans should use
the detailed shape with `Status`, `Inspected sections`, and `Evidence` so a
PASS or N/A cannot be treated as review evidence without a basis. Use the
detailed shape for every `must-change` or `should-change` finding.

For trivial plans, the only required persona pass is the Trigger Coverage
Verifier:

```text
Risk triggers matched: (none — trivial)
Importance/Risk: trivial
Review required: yes (Trigger Coverage Verifier only)
Plan reviewed: yes
Personas applied: Trigger Coverage Verifier
Revised after review: yes / no changes required
```

If review is not required (plan-exempt), record:

```text
Review required: no
Review exemption reason: <short reason>
```

Use `Revised after review: no changes required` only when the separate
persona passes found no must-change or should-change items.

Do not mark `Plan reviewed: yes` until the separate persona passes are
actually performed and recorded.

If the agent discovers during implementation that:

- review was skipped or compressed,
- a plan was falsely marked reviewed before persona passes ran,
- a trivial classification was wrong (a non-trivial trigger matches but was
  not cited), or
- the scope has expanded mid-execution to match a non-trivial trigger that
  was not present at the original classification,

implementation must stop. The agent reclassifies under the current plan
content, updates the plan's preflight fields and Domain Coverage to match
the reclassification, re-runs persona review per the new classification
(full review for non-trivial; Trigger Coverage Verifier only for trivial),
records the correction in the active plan when governance-relevant, and
resumes execution only from the revised plan.

## Persona Review Contract

Each persona review must produce plan edits, not general commentary.

Expected output per persona:

```text
Persona:
Severity: must-change / should-change / note
Plan risk found:
Required plan change:
Verification or gate to add:
Residual risk if accepted:
```

## Severity

- `must-change`: the plan should not execute until fixed.
- `should-change`: fix if cheap; execution can proceed only if the risk is
  accepted.
- `note`: useful observation, not a blocker.

## Selection Rule

1. Run the classification gate.
2. If planning is not required, do not run persona review.
3. For trivial plan-required work, run only the Trigger Coverage Verifier
   persona and the minimum plan-lint profile.
4. For non-trivial plan-required work:
   a. Run the Trigger Coverage Verifier first.
   b. Run the Deep Review Selector.
   c. Run selected universal deep-review personas sequentially.
   d. Run selected substance-triggered personas sequentially. A substance-
      triggered persona is invoked if its substance is marked as applicable in
      the plan's Domain Coverage section, if plan-lint flagged a mapped
      section, if Trigger Coverage Verifier flagged a missing mark, or if Deep
      Review Selector selects it with a concrete reason.
   e. Run selected sensitive-domain field personas sequentially.
   f. Run review-lint over all review outputs.
5. If a plan-exempt class escalates, treat it as non-trivial plan-required
   and apply step 4.
6. If the class is conditional, use the corresponding deck per the
   triggers in `task-classification.md`.
7. If a task has multiple classes, union the substance-triggered personas
   and remove duplicate roles. Run sequentially.
8. Universal concerns are always checked. They are not always executed as
   separate isolated persona turns.
9. Always run isolated reviewers for trust boundary, permission, sensitive
   data, state migration, external contract, irreversible action, rollback,
   governance/rule-system change, or high-impact legal/financial/medical
   decision when the plan touches that concern.
10. If more than eight deep-review personas are selected, the Integrator must
   decide whether the task is too broad. Default action is to split the task
   unless a concrete reason justifies expanded review.
11. Prefer fewer strong personas over many shallow personas. Never add a
   persona that cannot produce a concrete plan change.

## Deep Review Selection

For non-trivial plans, add a compact `Deep Review Selection` section or field
before separate persona passes:

```text
Universal concerns checked by plan-lint:
Isolated universal reviewers selected:
Specialized reviewers selected:
Sensitive-domain reviewers selected:
Reviewers not run with N/A reason:
Persona count:
Split-task warning: yes / no
```

Selection budget:

- trivial plan-required: Trigger Coverage Verifier only
- ordinary non-trivial: 2-5 isolated reviewers
- high-stakes non-trivial: 5-8 isolated reviewers
- more than 8: split-task review required

The selector must not use "not run" to hide a triggered high-risk concern.
Skipped reviewers need an N/A reason such as trigger absent, section not
touched, or lint passed.

## Consolidation

After persona reviews, consolidate findings into these buckets:

- Must change before execution.
- Nice to improve if cheap.
- Accept as known residual risk.

Then revise the plan once. Avoid another review loop unless a must-change item
creates a new irreversible or high-stakes risk.

The consolidation output should be short:

- must-change findings
- changes applied
- residual risks

Avoid copying the full pre-review plan into the final plan body.

## Finding Quality Bar

A useful finding includes at least one of:

- a missed step
- a wrong sequence
- a missing verification
- a missing user gate
- a missing source or authority check
- a rollback or recovery gap
- a scope leak
- a safe simplification

Do not keep weak findings that only restate generic caution.
