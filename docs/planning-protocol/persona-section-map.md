# Persona Section Map

## Purpose

Map each review persona to the plan-template sections it primarily reviews,
plus optional sections it may consult. The map drives **section-based
revision re-review** per `docs/law/PLANNING_AND_REVIEW_RULES.md` § Required
Planning Workflow: when a plan is revised after review, only the personas
whose mapped sections were revised are re-invoked.

## Format

- **Tier**: `universal` (always evaluated for non-trivial work),
  `substance-triggered` (evaluated when the corresponding Domain Coverage
  box is marked), or `sensitive-domain` (evaluated when the task class is
  in the sensitive-domain family).
- **Primary sections**: the persona must read these to do its review.
- **Optional sections**: the persona may consult these for context but
  does not need them to produce a finding.

When section-based re-review applies, a persona is re-invoked if **any of
its primary sections** changed in the revision. Optional-only changes do
not trigger re-invocation.

## Sensitive-Domain Field Personas

These personas apply only within sensitive-domain task classes (per
`task-classification.md`) and use field-specific vocabulary. They review
deliverable-quality dimensions that do not generalize to arbitrary
domains.

| Persona | Tier | Primary sections | Optional sections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Voice and Tone Reviewer | sensitive-domain (writing/editing) | Intent (artifact shape), Acceptance Criteria | Scope (audience) |
| Risk Language Reviewer | sensitive-domain (writing/editing/legal/medical) | Intent (artifact shape), Acceptance Criteria | Governance, Risk |
| Locale Specialist | sensitive-domain (translation/localization) | Intent (artifact shape) | Premise (sources for terminology) |
| Meaning Fidelity Reviewer | sensitive-domain (translation/localization) | Intent | Premise |
| Cultural Risk Reviewer | sensitive-domain (translation/localization, creative) | Intent, Acceptance Criteria | Scope (stakeholders) |
| Sensitive Language Reviewer | sensitive-domain (sensitive translation) | Intent | Premise |
| Risk and Sensitivity Reviewer | sensitive-domain (creative) | Intent, Acceptance Criteria | Risk |
| Accessibility Reviewer | sensitive-domain (visual/UI) | Intent (artifact shape), Acceptance Criteria | Scope (stakeholders) |
| Autonomy Preserver | sensitive-domain (personal advice/coaching) | Intent, Acceptance Criteria | Continuity |
| Emotional Reality Reviewer | sensitive-domain (personal advice/coaching) | Intent | Acceptance Criteria |
| Support Network Reviewer | sensitive-domain (personal advice/coaching) | Intent (acceptance/escalation) | Continuity |
| Learner Level Reviewer | sensitive-domain (explanation/teaching) | Intent, Acceptance Criteria | Scope (stakeholders) |

## Section Naming

The section names above match `docs/planning-protocol/plan-template.md`
exactly. Renaming a section in the template requires updating this map and
republishing both files together (Stage 4 mirror obligation).

## Section-Based Re-Review — Worked Example

Suppose a non-trivial plan is reviewed and the consolidation step requires
revisions to:

- the **Premise** section (a fact's verification was challenged), and
- the **Risk** section (a fallback was added).

Re-review invokes only personas whose primary sections include Premise or
Risk:

- Premise: Premise & Source Reviewer, Assumption-Path Reviewer, Prerequisite
  Chain Reviewer, Prior Art Reviewer, Source Conflict Reviewer (if marked),
  Runtime State Reviewer (if marked), Access-Premise Reviewer (if marked).
- Risk: Risk Classification Reviewer, User Gate Reviewer, Rollback Path
  Reviewer, Fallback Plan Reviewer.

Personas mapped to other primary sections (e.g., Intent Statement Reviewer)
are not re-invoked. Their prior findings stand because their sections did
not change.

The Trigger Coverage Verifier always re-runs after revisions because its
primary sections (Classification, Domain Coverage) implicitly depend on the
plan body and may need to re-check that revisions did not introduce a new
trigger.
