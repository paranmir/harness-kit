# Shared Harness Baseline

## Authority
This document is a contract document. It is the source of truth
for the distribution contract between agentlaw and target projects, shared with target projects via the bundled scaffold,
and its consistency with the scaffold tree and target project layout is mechanically enforced
by `agentlaw verify` (`_test_package_data_in_sync`).

Governing law: `docs/law/REPOSITORY_ARTIFACT_RULES.md`. Amendments land
through a plan that updates this file and any dependent law
clause in the same change.

## Purpose
This local workspace is itself a bootstrapped project instance of the shared Harness kit.

This file records the shared-kit baseline currently reflected in the workspace.
